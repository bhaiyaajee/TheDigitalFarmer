# TheDigitalFarmer
OBJECTIVES
•To provide a portal to the farmers where they can list their crops.
•To allow the Buyers to place a bid for the crops.
•To provide an interface to show maximum bids and MSP on the crops tomaximize the profit.
•To provide a “share crops” feature in case if the farmer isn’t getting anybuyer for their crops.

The project aims to develop a portal for the Farmers where they can list their crops and ask for a systematic bidding. We can call it a “Digital Mandi”. The buyers will be able to place their bidding price per unit, required quantity, delivery location etc. The final control will be in the farmer’s hand, for whom to sell and which bid to pick up giving them the negotiating power. So, the project aims to customize the farmer’s way of farming and selling to maximize their profit by making them aware of the active bids on their crops along with the MSP of the crops. Thus, the farmers will have losses less and profits more.
